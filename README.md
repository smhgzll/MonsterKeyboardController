# MonsterKeyboardController  
A custom keyboard lightning controller for <b>Monster</b> notebooks with rgb keyboard.  
You can easily pick any color to any section for each rgb channel.  
You can dim back-light more sensitively.  
These codes are retrieved from monster control center application(<b>GamingCenterU.exe</b>) by decompiling.  
So it still needs <b>"GCUService.exe"</b> up and running.
